# K-pop Card Exchange

## Project Overview

K-pop Card Exchange is an online platform where K-pop fans can find and propose trades for physical idol photo cards. The app does not support direct transactions of physical cards on the platform; instead, it allows users to discover other fans' collections, request card exchanges, and communicate through private messages to arrange shipping and exchange details.

### Key Features:
- **User Registration and Login**: Users can create an account and log in to manage their card collections and profile.
- **Profile Management**: Each user can manage their profile information, including details about the cards they own and wish to exchange.
- **Card Exchange Requests**: Users can browse through other users' collections, find cards they are interested in, and submit trade requests for specific cards.
- **Chat System**: The messaging feature allows users to discuss trades, negotiate terms, and arrange shipping for physical card exchanges.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can filter available cards based on idols, groups, or card types to find the perfect match for their trade.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is designed to be mobile-friendly and fully responsive across various devices.

**Note**: While the platform facilitates exchanges by connecting users, the exchange of physical cards must be coordinated externally between the users, and shipping details must be agreed upon through the chat system.
